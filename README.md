### Projects that I have made

- LIDAR Scanner (Arduino)
  - Using two servos and a micro lidar module (2m range) to scan a real life scene and then mark the points in a virtual scene.
  - In Progress

- 8 Cylinder Engine (Onshape)
  - Had the CAD model of a single cylinder engine that I got from the Udemy course I was learning through.
  - Modified those parts and joined them to turn it into an eight cylinder engine.
